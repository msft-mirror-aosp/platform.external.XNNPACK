name: "XNNPACK"
description: "XNNPACK is a highly optimized library of floating-point neural network inference operators for ARM, WebAssembly, and x86 (SSE2 level) platforms. XNNPACK is not intended for direct use by deep learning practitioners and researchers; instead it provides low-level performance primitives for accelerating high-level machine learning frameworks, such as MediaPipe, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js."
