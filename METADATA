description:
    "XNNPACK is a highly optimized library of floating-point neural network "
    "inference operators for ARM, WebAssembly, and x86 (SSE2 level) platforms. "
    "XNNPACK is not intended for direct use by deep learning practitioners and "
    "researchers; instead it provides low-level performance primitives for "
    "accelerating high-level machine learning frameworks, such as MediaPipe, "
    "TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js."
